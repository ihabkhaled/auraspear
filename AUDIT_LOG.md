# AuraSpear Platform — Full Audit Log

**Date**: 2026-03-15/16
**Scope**: All Phase 1-4 modules (frontend + backend)
**Result**: 56/56 CRUD operations passing, all stats/search/sort/pagination verified

---

## 1. Database & Schema Audit

- Verified Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) with 48 enums, 55+ models
- 17 migrations applied and up-to-date
- All Prisma enums use lowercase values (e.g., `critical`, `high`, `medium`)
- Identified 18+ models missing performance indexes (non-blocking, optimization opportunity)
- Confirmed unique constraints on: `(tenant_id, standard, version)` for ComplianceFramework, `(tenant_id, name)` for SOAR/Normalization, `(tenant_id, entity_name, entity_type)` for UEBA, `path_number` for AttackPath

## 2. Backend API Audit

### Endpoints Tested (all return 200/201)

| Module | GET List | GET :id | POST | PATCH :id | DELETE :id | GET Stats |
|--------|----------|---------|------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Incidents | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| Cases | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK (added) |
| Correlation | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| AI Agents | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| Vulnerabilities | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| Compliance | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| Attack Paths | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| SOAR | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| Reports | OK | OK | OK | OK (added) | OK | OK |
| Detection Rules | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| Cloud Security | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| Normalization | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| Rules Engine | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK | OK |
| UEBA Entities | OK | OK | OK (added) | OK (added) | OK (added) | OK |

### Issues Found & Fixed

1. **Correlation 500**: Prisma query error in service — field references fixed
2. **AI-Agents 500**: Service query error — types and utils fixed
3. **Reports 500**: Controller query parsing issue — fixed
4. **Normalization 404**: Controller route registration — fixed
5. **Rules Engine 404**: Module not properly wired — detection-rules module extended
6. **System Health 404**: Controller routes — fixed
7. **Attack Paths 500**: `pathNumber` generation collision (`parseInt` parsing year as number) — fixed generation logic
8. **Cases Stats**: Missing endpoint entirely — added `@Get('stats')` with full implementation
9. **Reports PATCH**: Missing endpoint entirely — added `@Patch(':id')` with DTO, service, repository, and utils
10. **UEBA CRUD**: Only had GET endpoints — added full POST/PATCH/DELETE for entities
11. **Compliance CREATE 500**: Unique constraint violation not caught — added 409 duplicate detection
12. **SOAR CREATE 500**: Unique constraint violation — added 409 duplicate detection
13. **Normalization CREATE 500**: Unique constraint violation — added 409 duplicate detection
14. **UEBA CREATE 500**: Unique constraint violation — added 409 duplicate detection

## 3. Frontend-Backend Contract Audit

### Enum Mismatches Fixed (11 total)

| Module | Frontend Enum | Prisma Enum | Fix |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-----|
| AI Agent Tier | `TIER_1='tier_1'` | `L0, L1, L2, L3` | Updated to `L0='L0'` etc. |
| AI Agent Type | `ALERT_TRIAGE='alert_triage'` | `detection, response, hunting, analysis` | Updated to match Prisma |
| AI Agent Status | `LEARNING='learning'` | `active, paused, error, training` | Updated to match Prisma |
| UEBA Entity Type | `IP='ip'` | `user, host, service_account, application` | Updated to match Prisma |
| UEBA Risk Level | Had `NONE` | Missing `normal` | Updated to match Prisma |
| UEBA ML Model Type | `REGRESSION='regression'` | `time_series, clustering, etc.` | Updated to match Prisma |
| Attack Path Status | `MONITORING='monitoring'` | `resolved` | Updated to match Prisma |
| Cloud Finding Status | Had extra `SUPPRESSED` | Missing in Prisma | Removed extra value |
| Normalization Status | Extra/wrong values | `active, inactive, error` | Updated to match |
| System Health Service Type | Connector names | `connector, database, api, queue, storage` | Updated to match |
| Detection Rule Type | `SIGMA='sigma'` | `threshold, anomaly, chain, scheduled` | Updated to match |

### Service URL Verification

All 15 frontend service files verified against backend controllers — all paths match correctly.

### Form Validation Fixes

- **Vulnerability Create/Edit**: `cvssScore` and `affectedHosts` inputs used `register()` without `valueAsNumber: true`, causing Zod validation to fail (string vs number)
- **Attack Path Create/Edit**: `affectedAssets` same issue
- **Compliance Create/Edit**: Added missing `version` field to frontend schema and forms

## 4. Search, Sort & Pagination

All 15 modules verified with:
- `?page=1&limit=2` — paginated response with `pagination.total`
- `?sortBy=createdAt&sortOrder=asc/desc` — sorting works
- `?query=test` — search works (where supported)

Modules that had sorting added: AI Agents, Attack Paths, Correlation, UEBA, Vulnerabilities, System Health.

## 5. Seed Data Audit

- Seeds are idempotent (use `upsert` pattern)
- All seed data uses correct Prisma enum values
- Admin credentials from `SEED_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` env var
- 4 tenants, multiple users per tenant

## 6. Build Verification

| Check | Backend | Frontend |
|-------|---------|----------|
| TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`) | 0 errors | 0 errors |
| ESLint | 0 errors, 304 warnings | 0 errors, 253 warnings |
| `nest build` | OK | — |
| `next build` | — | OK |

## 7. Final E2E Verification

**56/56 CRUD operations passed** across all 14 modules:
- 14 CREATE operations
- 14 READ operations
- 14 UPDATE operations
- 14 DELETE operations
- 13 STATS endpoints
- 15 SEARCH/SORT/PAGINATION combinations
